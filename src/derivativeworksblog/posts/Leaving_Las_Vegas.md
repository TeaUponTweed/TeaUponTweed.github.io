# Nicolas Un-caged #9, Leaving Las Vegas


_Do not watch_

In "Leaving Las Vegas", we watch Nic Cage drink himself to death over the course of several hours, all the while forming an unlikely relationship with a freelance prostitute.
The process is nearly as excruciating and uncomfortable for the audience as it is for Cage's character.
While not a typical movie-going experience, its novelty kept me engaged.
I got the distinct impression that there was some symbolism and message related to Nic Cage's conspicuously absent family.
However, I wasn't able to decipher it as the movie headed towards its inevitable anti-climax.
