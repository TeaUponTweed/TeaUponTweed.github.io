# Nicolas Un-caged #4, Moonstruck

_Do Watch_

A story as old as time:
Nic Cage plays a sexy, one handed baker with expensive tastes while Cher aspires to a loveless marriage with Cage's brother.
Predictably, the power of the moon causes them to fall madly in love and morphs this dry slice of late 80s Brooklyn life into a surreal comedy.
