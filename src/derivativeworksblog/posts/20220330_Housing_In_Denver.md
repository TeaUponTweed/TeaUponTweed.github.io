Housing In Denver March 30th, 2022
----------------------------------

Roughly, there are 4 things needed to survive comfortably:

1.  Food - Self explanatory. I eat out too much
2.  Water - Thanks to the modern miracle of municipal water, I only ever foresee this as an opt-in issue when backpacking although climate change might bite me here
3.  Shelter - Or more generally, where you live and how that enables your lifestyle
4.  Entertainment - I'm lumping everything else "non-essential" in here. Think travel, hiking boots, Netflix, etc.

For categories 1,2,& 4 I'm a fairly standard consumer. However, I seem unreasonably choosy on category 3. Ideally, I'd live near walkable grocery store & entertainment (read breweries), bikeable friends & work, with nature access for running and hiking. There exist places like this in and around the Denver metro, but they are rare and therefore quite expensive and over the last two years have gotten much more so. Should I bite the bullet and opt in now? _Since I am derive an above average amount of value from housing, most scenarios benefit me, even dips._

Let's think through the bounding and expected scenarios, assuming of course that the world doesn't blow up):

### Denver house prices continue to rise like crazy

At this point, the government is allowing me to make a nicely leveraged bet that has paid off nicely. At this point I should be able to move anywhere cheaper than Denver if I want to, i.e. most (many?) places.

### Denver house prices rise with inflation

Assuming that house prices don't change much relative to the other categories, It's just a cash sync. While not ideal, as long as I can tolerate the monthly payments and still hit good targets for investing in index funds I'll probably be fine. This will help me to move towards a more diverse portfolio and reduce my bond allocations.

### Denver house prices tank

This feels like it would suck. In the worst case, I'd potentially owe more on the house than it was worth, essentially wiping out my down payment and any principal I'd payed off; essentially I'd have been paying a very high rent and squander lots of cash. However, in this case shelter (a category that I am very sensitive to) would have become much cheaper which disproportionately benefits me. Assuming I was able to maintain an income, I can now write off my sunk cost and buy in at a much lower level.

### My particular neighborhood house prices tank

This would suck, let's try and avoid this. If this happened, I'd have to give up and move somewhere with lower cost of living.

### Conclusion

Probably buy a house, even if it's not perfect. Back to the scrabbling masses I go
