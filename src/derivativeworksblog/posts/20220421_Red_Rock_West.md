Un-caged #6, Red Rock West

**Do Not Watch**

Southern Wyoming's stunning vistas set the stage for a tale of love, lust, and murder.
Specifically: Love of money, lust for bad decision making, and normal murder.
The film is sustained by a healthy dose of camp and action, barely saving it from going off the rails.
If you're a fan of picturesque prairies and nail-biting train escapes, this is a maybe-watch.
