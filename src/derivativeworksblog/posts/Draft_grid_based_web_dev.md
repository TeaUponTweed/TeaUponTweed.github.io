Through the years I have gotten much faster at doing web dev
Initially I played around with firebase since I did not want to deal with the complexities of hosting/backend server/database/front end
Most of that is not too bad, but working with the front end still takes me a ludicrous amount of time
Writing bare html goes quickly but looks quite bad
How to make a system that is more explicit. I'd rather be verbose and precise than try and trick the browser into showing what I want
Can't handle frameworks
Solution is CSS grid + Elm
