Nicolas Un-caged #1, "Valley Girl" March 6th, 2022, Edited November 20th, 2022
--------------------------------------------------

At the start of every year, some friends and I run a [white elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange) but with new years resolutions.

These resolutions are generally intended for laughs and go sadly unfulfilled.
However, I was intrigued and tickled with my lot for 2022:
"Watch all Nicolas Cage moves, and make a presentation of your findings" [1].
Since following the letter of the "resolution" seems out of reach due to Cage's 70+ acting credits, I'll be following these revised rules:
- Only films in which Mr Cage _stars_ qualify. A cameo does not justify a 2 hour movie.
- Only watch "notable" movies or those with at least a 7.0 on imdb
- Watch in chronological order
- Break the rules _only_ if it sounds fun or is convenient

Each post will begin with an upfront watch recomendation. Below that, spoilers may abound.

Let's start off by breaking the rules and watching the not-that-well rated and quite obscure Valley girl.
In some ways, the tagline says it all:
"She's cool. He's hot. She's from the valley. He's not."

**Do Not Watch**

Most notable as being Cage's first starring credit, this movie is, like, really not that good.
Additionally, Nic Cage is sooo not that hot.
One fun fact is that the eponymous valley refers to the San Fernando Valley, which is part of the city of LA.
I had always assumed "Valley Girls" were related to something agricultural
This misconception can likely be traced to thepicture on bottles of Hidden Valley Ranch.

[1] At the time I was not aware this was a Community reference. It is still very funny.
