Nicolas Un-caged #2, "Birdy" March 27th, 2022, Edited November 21st, 2022

**Do Watch**

He's a man, he's a bird, he's a plane!...No he's a bird.
Birdy has serious "how do you do, fellow kids" energy, with a mid-20s Nic Cage playing a troubled high school student for much of the film.
This combined with a kooky sense of humor lend the film a surreal but not unpleasant air.
These elements really do come home to roost in the last 15 minutes of the film and you can't help but egg the action on.
