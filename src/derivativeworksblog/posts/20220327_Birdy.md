Nicolas Un-caged #2, "Birdy" March 27th, 2022
---------------------------------------------

_Nicolas Cage is timeless, therefore it is only fitting that I don't respect his film chronology. I'm skipping "Racing The Moon" and likely many more. That didn't take long._

He's a man, he's a bird, he's a plane!...No he's a bird. [Birdy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086969/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_104) has serious "how do you do, fellow kids" energy, with a mid-20s Nic Cage playing a troubled high school student for much of the film, combined with a kooky sense of humor lend the film a surreal but not unpleasant air. These elements really do come home to roost in the last 15 minutes of the film and you can't help but egg the action on.
