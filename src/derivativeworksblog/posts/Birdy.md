# Nicolas Un-caged #2, "Birdy"

_Do Watch_

He's a man, he's a bird, he's a plane!...No, he's a bird.
Birdy has serious "how do you do, fellow kids" energy, with a mid-20s Nic Cage playing a troubled high school student for much of the film.
This, combined with a kooky sense of humor, lends the film a surreal but not unpleasant air.
These elements come home to roost in the last 15 minutes of the film and you can't help but egg the action on.
