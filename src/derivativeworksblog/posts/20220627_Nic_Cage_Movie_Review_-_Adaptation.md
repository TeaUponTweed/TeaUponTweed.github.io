# Nicolas Un-caged #9, Adaptation

Adaptation asks a question: "what if an idea doesn't have enough legs?"
And answers it with: "write about how annoying it is that you're commited to a not great idea, and see how that goes."

_Do Watch_

"Adaptation" is a movie.
Not only is it a movie, but it's also about the making of one.
The movie being made is an adaptation of a book.
That book being adapted, "The Orchid Thief", is about flowers that have adapted to a very particular niche.
Nic Cage pulls double duty in this film, taking us on a journey from introspective thoughts on writing to the wilds of the Florida swamp.

I found myself watching "Adaptation" and loving it, as I have almost all of the Nic Cage movies thus far despite their variable quality.
This realization has led me to conclude that, in the context of low-time-commitment and scarce fields like movies, having expectations and doing research may not be worth it.
The damage you do to your enjoyment by knowing anything about a movie, even its genre, can dramatically affect your perception of it. This knowledge takes away the joy of discovery that, although perhaps not intended by the creators, still enriches the experience.
When "good enough" media is readily available, you might find more enjoyment than in meticulously choosing from the best in the world.
The IMDB Top 250 list could partially fulfill this role, but it inevitably comes with a certain expectation of greatness.
