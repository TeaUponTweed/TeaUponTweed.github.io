Un-caged #9, Adaptation, June 27th, 2022
---------------------------------------------

Adaptation answers the question "what if an idea does not have enough legs" with "write about how annoying it is that you're commited to a not great idea and see how that goes". Adaptation is a movie. It is also a movie about the making of a movie, specifically, Adaptation, and how that evolved into its particular niche. Nic Cage does the work of two men in the film, which meanders from thoughts on writing, to the florida swamp, while still adapting the essentials of the real book "The Orchid Theif". Highly recommended.

I found my self watching Adaptation and loving it, as I have almost all of the Nic Cage movies thus far despite their variable quality. This has led me to a conclusion: Expectation and research are note worth it for movies (or any low time commitment, scarce field like movies). The damage you do to your enjoyment by knowing anything about it, even the genre, can dramatically affect how you perceive that media and take away the joy of discovery that, if not intented by the creatiors, still enriches the experience. When "good enough" media is delivered to you on a platter you are happier than carefully selecting from the best in the world. The IMDB top 250 could serve some of this purpose, but it carries with it a certain expectation of goodness.
