Recipes Are Too Prescriptive
-----------------------------------

Cooking is an art, not a science, yet most recipes read like they've been pulled straight from a high school chemistry lab manual.
Whipping up a meal is inherently creative, thanks to the endless variations in ingredients, environments, equipment, and taste buds.
So, it's high time recipes evolved from a strict to-do list and tapped into our thinking, feeling, human potential.
In other words, recipes should focus on the end goal, rather than merely listing the steps.

Take, for instance, the instruction to 'add 363 grams of flour to mix.'
A better alternative might be, 'add about 350 grams of flour, or just enough to make the dough sticky and easy to work with.'
The absence of the all-important 'why' is even more baffling when it comes to online recipes.
On the internet, you'll often find yourself scrolling through six pages of SEO-optimized cooking 'narratives' just to get to the actual meat of the recipe.
Sure, we can appreciate the effort it takes to convince us that a Caesar salad recipe is somehow emotionally significant.
But let's be real â€“ your heartfelt connection to romaine lettuce isn't helping anyone whip up a killer dressing.

That said, adopting a more interactive approach to recipes doesn't mean we have to abandon an analytical mindset. For instance:
_Cook about 40 minutes until crust is golden brown and internal temp is 200 degrees F._
_At this temperature, the bread will be fully cooked but the water will still be liquid leaving the interior moist and delicious_.

Sure, this style might be wordier, but understanding the 'why' behind recipes makes home cooking a whole lot more enjoyable and reliable.
As a bonus tip, taking the time to transcribe recipes by hand can help you distill the information, ensuring you focus on the essentials that you need to know.
