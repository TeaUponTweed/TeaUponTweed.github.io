Recipes Are Too Prescriptive March 30th, 2022, Edited November 22nd, 2022
-----------------------------------

Cooking is an art not a science, but most recipes read like a high school chemistry lab instructions.
Making food is necessarily a creative pursuit because of the variation in ingredients, environment, equipment, & taste.
Therefore, recipes need to evolve from prescriptive list of tasks and make use of the thinking, feeling human potential.
Recipes should describe the _goal_, not just the steps.

For example, instead of _Add 363 grams of flour to mix_.
Prefer _Add about 350 grams of flour, until dough is sticky and you can work it easily_.
The lack of "why" is even more astounding in the realm of internet recipes.
Online, most recipes have a half dozen pages of SEO optimized cooking "narrative" that you must scroll through to get the _meat_.

One can appreciate the effort that went into making the case that "this recipe for ceasar salad is emotionally significant to you."
However, your connection doesn't help anyone make a dressing.

Having a more interactive recipe doesn't preclude being analytical. For example:
_Cook about 40 minutes until crust is golden brown and internal temp is 200 degrees F._
_At this temperature, the bread will be fully cooked but the water will still be liquid leaving the interior moist and delicious_.

While this style is more verbose, it helps people learn the "why" behind recipes which makes home cooking both more fun and more reliable.
As a final step, transcribing recipes by hand helps to re-condense the information and focus on what _you_ need to know.
