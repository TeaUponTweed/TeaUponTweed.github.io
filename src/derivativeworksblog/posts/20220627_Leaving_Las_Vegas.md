Un-caged #8, Leaving Las Vegas, June 27th, 2022
---------------------------------------------

In Leaving Las Vegas, you watch Nic Cage drink himself to death over the course of several hours while fostering an unlikely relationship with a freelance prostitute. The process is nearly as excruciating and uncomfortable for the audience as it is for Cage's character. While not the typical movie going experience, it was novel enough to keep me engaged. I got the distinct impression that there was some symbolism and message pertaining to Nic Cage's conspicuously absent family, but I wasn't able to pick it apart while the movie heads towards its inevitable anti-climax.
