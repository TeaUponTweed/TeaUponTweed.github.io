# Nicolas Un-caged #1, "Valley Girl"

Let's watch all* the Nicolas Cage movies!
*Or rather, only films which:
- Nic Cage _stars_ in
- Are "notable" or those with at least a 7.0 on IMDB
The plan is to watch them in chronological order, breaking the rules only if it's fun or convenient

We start off by breaking the rules and watching the not-that-well rated and quite obscure Valley Girl.
In some ways, the tagline says it all:
"She's cool. He's hot. She's from the valley. He's not."

_Do Not Watch_

Most notable for being Cage's first starring credit, this movie is, like, really not that good.
Additionally, Nic Cage is so not that hot.
One fun fact is that the eponymous valley refers to the San Fernando Valley, which is part of the city of LA.
I had always assumed "Valley Girls" were related to something agricultural.
This misconception can likely be traced to the picture on bottles of Hidden Valley Ranch.
