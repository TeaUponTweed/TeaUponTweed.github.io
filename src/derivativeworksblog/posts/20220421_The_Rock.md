Un-caged #7, The Rock, April 21st, 2022, Edited November 22nd, 2022
--------------------------------------

The Rock is the chronologically first Nic Cage movie that's generally well known and well regarded.
This was exciting, but it lead inevitably the cardinal sin of movie watching: having expectations.

**Do Not Watch**

For those who aren't aware, the plot goes something like:
Terrorists take over Alcatraz and hold the city of San Francisco under threat of annihilation with chemical weapons.
Cage is a hot shot bio man.
Sean Connery, a former SaS agent, has been imprisoned for decades under suspicion of knowing too much.
He is also the only man to ever break out of Alcatraz and live to tell the tale.
Inevitably, a three letter agency the duo to try and defuse the situation.
A reverse prison breaks ensues, including firefights, betrayals, and Cage acting scared of glass potpourri.
Meanwhile, Cage's girlfriend flies out to San Francisco up the drama.
Also she's pregnant.
Eventually the duo manage to save the day by defeating the terrorists and scaring off the retaliatory F16s with a torch.
Fin.

Thus far in this journey through the cage-lantic, all the best movies have been "quirky".
Unfortunately, the virtues of a good action movie are different from those of a dry comedy like Moonlight and left me cold.
As a rock.
