Un-caged #7, The Rock, April 21st, 2022
--------------------------------------

As the Rock is the first of these early Nic Cage movies that I'd heard of, it led me to commit the cardinal sin of movie watching: having expectations. Sean Connery plays a former SaS agent who's been imprisoned for most of his life under suspicion of knowing too much. Reverse prison breaks ensues and Cage acts very scared of glass potpourri before eventually winning the day by scaring off several F16s with fire, their one weakness.

Thus far in my journey through the caglantic, most of the movies I've enjoyed could be accurately described as "quirky" with The Rock being the first one that was generally regarded as "actually good". Unfortunately, the virtues of an actually good action movie (actionally good?) are very different from those of a stealth comedy like Moonlight
