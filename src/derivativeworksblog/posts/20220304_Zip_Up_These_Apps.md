Zip Up These Apps March 4th, 2022
---------------------------------

There's something infuriating when _offline_ Siri can transcribe my speech in a noisy room down to "Hey Siri, what time is it", a daunting task that confounded computer scientists for decades but then refuses to go the last mile: telling me the time. I'm interested in simple apps which are "good enough" and lean more on the user in exchange for being predictable and responsive. I don't want to talk to my IPhone like a person, just like I'm fine not writing letters to a C++ compiler. If given the choice between a zippy limited human/machine interface and a clunky "general" one, I'll choose zippy every time. Hopefully this idea will have an incidental tailwind: The growing awareness of the potential downsides of exclusively server side apps. Some recent lambastings include [Grammarly](https://www.kolide.com/blog/is-grammarly-a-keylogger-what-can-you-do-about-it) for writing and [Otter.ai](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/16/my-journey-down-the-rabbit-hole-of-every-journalists-favorite-app-00009216) for dictation. Honestly, Otter.ai looks like it's waiting to get unseated by a weekend hackathon leveraging [Mozilla's DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech).
