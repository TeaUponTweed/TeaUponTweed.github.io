# Nicolas Un-caged #7, The Rock

"The Rock" is the first Nic Cage movie chronologically that was both well-known and well-regarded.
This was exciting, but it led inevitably to the cardinal sin of movie watching: having expectations.

_Do Not Watch_

For the uninitiated, here's a quick rundown of the plot:
Terrorists take over Alcatraz and hold the city of San Francisco under threat of annihilation with chemical weapons.
Cage stars as a hotshot biochemist thrown into the mix.
Sean Connery plays a former SAS agent who's been locked away for decades, simply for knowing too much.
Oh, and conveniently he's also the only man to ever escape Alcatraz and live to brag about it.
Naturally, a mysterious three-letter agency enlists the duo to save the day.
A reverse prison break unfolds, complete with firefights, betrayals, and Cage's inexplicable fear of glass potpourri.
Meanwhile, Cage's pregnant girlfriend flies to San Francisco, because what's an action flick without some extra drama.
Eventually, the duo saves the day by defeating the terrorists and warding off the retaliatory F-16s with a torch.
Fin.

So far, our journey through Cage's filmography has shown that his best movies tend to be, well, "quirky".

Sadly, the dry humor of a film like "Moonlight" doesn't quite translate action flick like "The Rock", leaving me feeling cold.
Cold as a "The Rock", that is.
