**Do Not Watch**

When watching ["Left Behind"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467046/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_39), I expected to be transported.
However, my sins of film critiques were such that I was forced to endure three plagues:
First, a swarm of wooden actors desolated the screen.
Second, a contrived plot strained all modest bounds of credulity (I'm looking at you, accidental mid-air collision over the Atlantic).
Finally, the death of the first born sunny-disposition, when the plane successfully landed and set the stage for a sequel that I'd probably have to watch if it ever got made.
But like all parables, there is a moral to this story: you don't have to be good to be entertaining.
