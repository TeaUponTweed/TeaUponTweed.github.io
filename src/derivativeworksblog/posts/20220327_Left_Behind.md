**Do Not Watch**

_Big jump here, blame amazon prime's selection and convenience along with the enticingly poor score of 3.1/10, his worst according to IMDB._

When watching [Left Behind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467046/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_39), I expected to be transported.
However, my sins of film criticisms were such that I was forced to endure three plagues: First, a swarm of wooden actors desolated the screen.
Second, a contrived plot strained all modest bounds of credulity.
(Looking at you, accidental mid-air collision over the Atlantic)
Finally, the death of the first born sunny disposition when the plane successfully landed and set the stage for a sequel that I'll probably have to watch.
But like all parables, there is a moral to this story: you don't have to be good to be entertaining.
