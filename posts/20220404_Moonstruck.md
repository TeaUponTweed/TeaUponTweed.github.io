Un-caged #5, Moonstruck April 20th, 2022
----------------------------------------

A story as old as time: Nic Cage plays a sexy, one handed baker with expensive tastes while Cher aspires to a loveless marriage with Cage's brother. Predictably, the power of the moon causes them to fall madly in love and morphs this dry slice of late 80s Brooklyn life into a surreal comedy.
