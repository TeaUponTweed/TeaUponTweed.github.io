Un-caged #4, Raising Arizona April 4th, 2022
--------------------------------------------

A funny, feel-good, game of hot-potato, where the potato is a baby. The first of these films that I'd actually recommend people watch. Written and directed by the Coen brothers, this film is on the lighter side of their work and has serious “O Brother Where Art Thou” energy.

Rather than the 2D Nic Cage graph, I want to reign things in and condense it to a DND-esque alignment chart:

*   Good/Neutral/Bad - rough quality of film
*   A Lot Of Nic Cage/Some Nic Cage/Bees - how well does this film exemplify Nic Cage

To kick off the new system (the previous 3 will get alignments added) I can confidently state that Raising Arizona is _Good/Some Guy_
