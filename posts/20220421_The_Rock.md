Un-caged #7, The Rock April 21st, 2022
--------------------------------------

The Rock is the first of these early Nic Cage movies that I'd heard of, which led me to commit the cardinal sin of movie watching: having expectations. Sean Connery plays a former SaS agent who's been imprisoned for most of his life under suspicion of knowing too much. Reverse prison breaks ensues and Cage acts very scared of glass potpourri before eventually winning the day by scaring off several F16s with fire, their one weakness.
