Nicolas Un-caged #1, "Valley Girl" March 6th, 2022
--------------------------------------------------

At the start of every year, some friends and I run a [white elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange), but with new years resolutions. These resolutions, like most, usually go unfulfilled but this year I wanted to give mine a go: "Watch all Nicolas Cage moves". I'm working in chronological order, and only taking movies starring Mr. Cage, so here's what I thought of [Valley Girl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/), 1983:

This movie is, like, really not that good, and Nic Cage is so not that hot. One fun fact is that the eponymous valley refers to the San Fernando Valley, which is part of the city of LA. I had always assumed "Valley Girls" were related to something agricultural, which can probably be blamed on the picture on bottles of Hidden Valley Ranch.

**Rating: DNF**  
**Would recommend to people who want to hear a smattering of 80s music in the background.**
