Recipes Are Broken March 30th, 2022
-----------------------------------

Cooking, even home cooking, is an art not a science. It is necessarily a creative endeavor because of the variation in ingredients, environment, & equipment. Therefore, we should stop treating recipes as a prescriptive manufacturing job and instead as an interactive endeavor. Recipes should describe the goal not just the steps.

Instead of _Add 363 grams of flour to mix_, prefer _Add about 350 grams of flour, until dough is sticky but can be worked with easily_. Being interactive does not preclude being analytical: _Cook about 40 minutes until crust is golden brown and internal temp is 200 degrees F; at this temperature, the bread will be fully cooked but the water will still be liquid leaving the interior moist and delicious_. While this style is more verbose, it helps people learn the "why" behind recipes which makes home cooking not only more fun, but more reliable.

The lack of "why" is even more astounding in the realm of internet recipes, most every site has half a dozen pages of cooking "narrative" that you must scroll through to get the the _meat_. I can maybe buy that this recipe for ceasar salad is emotionally significant to you, but it does not help me make the dressing.

Personally, I'm a huge fan of transcribing recipes by hand, as it allows me remove the unnecessary (to me) information and focus on what I need to know: usually what order and quantity of ingredients.
