Un-caged #6, Red Rock West April 21st, 2022
-------------------------------------------

Stunning vistas of Southern Wyoming provide a beige canvas on which a story of love, lust, and murder are painted. Love of money, lust for bad decision making, and normal murder. There's enough camp and action throughout to sustain the movie, but only just. Recommended for fans of prairies and dramatic train escapes.
