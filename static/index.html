<!--           Expect new articles twice a week, nominally Wednesday and Sunday.

          In my day job I work with python, and for side projects I've been working with Go and Elm so expect to see writing in those areas.
          I also have a long standing interest in all things optimization, be it mathematical, financial, or domestic.
          Finally, I'll probably post some poorly researched thoughts on homomorphic encryption because I think it's cool.
          As a reader, I hope you find the writing entertaining and informative.
          As a writer, the purpose of this blog is three-fold: First to improve my writing and communication skills, second to practice being wrong in a public forum, and finally create a record of my thoughts and work.

          When I'm not hunched over a computer, I try to be in the woods, or sometimes a brewery. -->

          <p>
            There's something infuriating about when <em>offline</em> Siri can transcribe my speech in a noisy room down to "Hey Siri, what time is it", a daunting task that confounded computer scientists for decades but then refuses to go the last mile:
            telling me the time.
            I'm interested in simple apps which are "good enough" and lean more on the user in exchange for being predictable and responsive.
            I don't want to talk to my IPhone like a person, just like I'm fine not writing letters to a C++ compiler.
            If given the choice between a zippy limited human machine interface and a clunky "general" one, I'll choose zippy every time.
            This is compounded by the growing awareness of the potential downsides of exclusively server side apps such as <a href="https://www.kolide.com/blog/is-grammarly-a-keylogger-what-can-you-do-about-it"> Grammarly </a> for writing and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/16/my-journey-down-the-rabbit-hole-of-every-journalists-favorite-app-00009216"> Otter.ai </a> for dictation.
            Otter.ai in particular just looks like it's waiting to get unseated by a weekend hackathon leveraging <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech"> Mozilla's DeepSpeech</a>.

        <h2>Nicolas Un-caged #1, "Valley Girl" <time datetime="2022-03-06">March 6th, 2022</time></h2>
        
        <article>
          <p>
            At the start of every year, some friends and I run a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange">white elephant</a>, but with new years resolutions.
            These resolutions, like most, usually go unfulfilled but this year I wanted to give mine a go: "Watch all Nicolas Cage moves".
            I'm working in chronological order, and only taking movies starring Mr. Cage, so here's what I thought of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/">Valley Girl</a>, 1983:
          </p>
          <p>
            This movie is, like, really not that good, and Nic Cage is so not that hot. One fun fact is that the eponymous valley refers to the San Fernando Valley, which is part of the city of LA.
            I had always assumed "Valley Girls" were related to something agricultural, which can probably be blamed on the picture on bottles of Hidden Valley Ranch.
