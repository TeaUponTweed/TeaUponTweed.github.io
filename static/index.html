<!--           Expect new articles twice a week, nominally Wednesday and Sunday.

          In my day job I work with python, and for side projects I've been working with Go and Elm so expect to see writing in those areas.
          I also have a long standing interest in all things optimization, be it mathematical, financial, or domestic.
          Finally, I'll probably post some poorly researched thoughts on homomorphic encryption because I think it's cool.
          As a reader, I hope you find the writing entertaining and informative.
          As a writer, the purpose of this blog is three-fold: First to improve my writing and communication skills, second to practice being wrong in a public forum, and finally create a record of my thoughts and work.

          When I'm not hunched over a computer, I try to be in the woods, or sometimes a brewery. -->

          <h2>Privacy Respecting Apps <time datetime="2022-03-04">March 4th, 2022</time></h2>
          <p>
            There is a market for apps which prioritize actual user experience, part of which is respecting their users privacy. Several articles have been circulating recently on Hacker News emphasizing the potential downsides of very popular and highly functional apps like <a href="https://www.kolide.com/blog/is-grammarly-a-keylogger-what-can-you-do-about-it"> Grammarly </a> for writing and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/16/my-journey-down-the-rabbit-hole-of-every-journalists-favorite-app-00009216"> Otter.ai </a> for dictation.
            As people become more aware of the privacy and potential legal implications of sharing unspecified swaths of personal data, from well established mega-corps down to start-ups with a flashy landing page, there is the potential to disrupt these established Apps. For many, an app which is "good enough "and doesn't steal your data might be preferable, and the open source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech"> Mozilla's DeepSpeech</a> will help bridge the data & technology gap. Would it be possible to reach feature parity with Grammarly using only a publicly available corpus? I'd expect the internet, and this site in particular, to provide ample examples of poor grammar.

            While the state of freely-available technology might be lowering the entry to these niches, there is another adjacent niche that seems under explored: that of true personalization. Other than some fine tuning on voice assistants and collaborative filtering applications such as Pandora, most machine learning based applications only use your data to benefit you in a very dilute sense. By casting your cup of information into the vast training sea you should be having a fractionally better experience (assuming you're part of a segment large enough to be optimized for), but few companies are able to adapt their offering more directly to you.

        <h2>Nicolas Un-caged #1, "Valley Girl" <time datetime="2022-03-06">March 6th, 2022</time></h2>
        
        <article>
          <p>
            At the start of every year, some friends and I run a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange">white elephant</a>, but with new years resolutions.
            These resolutions, like most, usually go unfulfilled but this year I wanted to give mine a go: "Watch all Nicolas Cage moves".
            I'm working in chronological order, and only taking movies starring Mr. Cage, so here's what I thought of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/">Valley Girl</a>, 1983:
          </p>
          <p>
            This movie is, like, really not that good, and Nic Cage is so not that hot. One fun fact is that the eponymous valley refers to the San Fernando Valley, which is part of the city of LA.
            I had always assumed "Valley Girls" were related to something agricultural, which can probably be blamed on the picture on bottles of Hidden Valley Ranch.
