          <p>
            There's something infuriating when <em>offline</em> Siri can transcribe my speech in a noisy room down to "Hey Siri, what time is it", a daunting task that confounded computer scientists for decades but then refuses to go the last mile:
            telling me the time.
            I'm interested in simple apps which are "good enough" and lean more on the user in exchange for being predictable and responsive.
            I don't want to talk to my IPhone like a person, just like I'm fine not writing letters to a C++ compiler.
            If given the choice between a zippy limited human/machine interface and a clunky "general" one, I'll choose zippy every time.
            Hopefully this idea will have an incidental tailwind: The growing awareness of the potential downsides of exclusively server side apps.

        <h2>Nicolas Un-caged #1, "Valley Girl" <time datetime="2022-03-06">March 6th, 2022</time></h2>
        
        <article>
          <p>
            At the start of every year, some friends and I run a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange">white elephant</a>, but with new years resolutions.
            These resolutions, like most, usually go unfulfilled but this year I wanted to give mine a go: "Watch all Nicolas Cage moves".
            I'm working in chronological order, and only taking movies starring Mr. Cage, so here's what I thought of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/">Valley Girl</a>, 1983:
          </p>
          <p>
            This movie is, like, really not that good, and Nic Cage is so not that hot. One fun fact is that the eponymous valley refers to the San Fernando Valley, which is part of the city of LA.
            I had always assumed "Valley Girls" were related to something agricultural, which can probably be blamed on the picture on bottles of Hidden Valley Ranch.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          <b> Rating: DNF </b> <br>
          <b> Would recommend to people who want to hear a smattering of 80s music in the background. </b>

          <p>
            <em>
              Nicolas Cage is timeless, therefore it is only fitting that I don't respect his film chronology. I'm skipping "Racing The Moon" and likely many more. That didn't take long.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            He's a man, he's a bird, he's a plane!...No he's a bird. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086969/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_104"> Birdy</a> has serious "how do you do, fellow kids" energy, with a mid-20s Nic Cage playing a troubled high school student for much of the film, combined with a kooky sense of humor lend the film a surreal but not unpleasant air. These elements really do come home to roost in the last 15 minutes of the film and you can't help but egg the action on.

        <article>
            <em>
              Big jump here, blame amazon prime's selection and convenience along with the enticingly poor score of 3.1/10, his worst according to IMDB.
            </em>
          <p>
            When watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467046/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_39">Left Behind</a>, I expected to be transported. However, my sins of film criticisms were such that I was forced to endure three plagues:
            First, a swarm of wooden actors desolated the screen.
            Second, a contrived plot strained all modest bounds of credulity. (Looking at you, accidental mid-air collision over the Atlantic)
            Finally, the death of the first born sunny disposition when the plane successfully landed and set the stage for a sequel that I'll probably have to watch.
            But like all parables, there is a moral to this story: you don't have to be good to be entertaining.

      <h2>Recipes Are Broken <time datetime="2022-03-30">March 30th, 2022</time></h2>

      <p>
        Cooking, even home cooking, is an art not a science.
        It is necessarily a creative endeavor because of the variation in ingredients, environment, &amp; equipment.
        Therefore, we should stop treating recipes as a prescriptive manufacturing job and instead as an interactive endeavor.
        Recipes should describe the goal not just the steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of <em>Add 363 grams of flour to mix</em>,
        prefer <em>Add about 350 grams of flour, until dough is sticky but can be worked with easily</em>.
        Being interactive does not preclude being analytical:
        <em>Cook about 40 minutes until crust is golden brown and internal temp is 200 degrees F; at this temperature, the bread will be fully cooked but the water will still be liquid leaving the interior moist and delicious</em>.
        While this style is more verbose, it helps people learn the "why"
        behind recipes which makes home cooking not only more fun, but more reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of "why" is even more astounding in the realm of internet recipes, most every site has half a dozen pages of cooking "narrative" that you must scroll through to get the the <em>meat</em>.
        I can maybe buy that this recipe for ceasar salad is emotionally significant to you, but it does not help me make the dressing.
      </p>


      <p>
        Personally, I'm a huge fan of transcribing recipes by hand, as it allows me remove the unnecessary (to me) information and focus on what I need to know: usually what order and quantity of ingredients.

      <h2>Housing In Denver <time datetime="2022-03-30">March 30th, 2022</time></h2>

      <p>Roughly, there are 4 things needed to survive comfortably:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Food - Self explanatory. I eat out too much</li>
      <li>Water - Thanks to the modern miracle of municipal water, I only ever foresee this as an opt-in issue when backpacking although climate change might bite me here</li>
      <li>Shelter - Or more generally, where you live and how that enables your lifestyle</li>
      <li>Entertainment - I'm lumping everything else &quot;non-essential&quot; in here. Think travel, hiking boots, Netflix, etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For categories 1,2,&amp; 4 I'm a fairly standard consumer. However, I seem unreasonably choosy on category 3. Ideally, I'd live near walkable grocery store &amp; entertainment (read breweries), bikeable friends &amp; work, with nature access for running and hiking. There exist places like this in and around the Denver metro, but they are rare and therefore quite expensive and over the last two years have gotten much more so. Should I bite the bullet and opt in now? <em>Since I am derive an above average amount of value from housing, most scenarios benefit me, even dips.</em></p>
      <p>Let's think through the bounding and expected scenarios, assuming of course that the world doesn't blow up):</p>
      <h3 id="denver-house-prices-continue-to-rise-like-crazy">Denver house prices continue to rise like crazy</h3>
      <p>At this point, the government is allowing me to make a nicely leveraged bet that has paid off nicely. At this point I should be able to move anywhere cheaper than Denver if I want to, i.e. most (many?) places.</p>
      <h3 id="denver-house-prices-rise-with-inflation">Denver house prices rise with inflation</h3>
      <p>Assuming that house prices don't change much relative to the other categories, It's just a cash sync. While not ideal, as long as I can tolerate the monthly payments and still hit good targets for investing in index funds I'll probably be fine. This will help me to move towards a more diverse portfolio and reduce my bond allocations.</p>
      <h3 id="denver-house-prices-tank">Denver house prices tank</h3>
      <p>This feels like it would suck. In the worst case, I'd potentially owe more on the house than it was worth, essentially wiping out my down payment and any principal I'd payed off; essentially I'd have been paying a very high rent and squander lots of cash. However, in this case shelter (a category that I am very sensitive to) would have become much cheaper which disproportionately benefits me. Assuming I was able to maintain an income, I can now write off my sunk cost and buy in at a much lower level.</p>
      <h3 id="my-particular-neighborhood-house-prices-tank">My particular neighborhood house prices tank</h3>
      <p>This would suck, let's try and avoid this. If this happened, I'd have to give up and move somewhere with lower cost of living.</p>
      <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Probably buy a house, even if it's not perfect. Back to the scrabbling masses I go</p>

      <h2>Un-caged #4, Raising Arizona <time datetime="2022-04-04">April 4th, 2022</time></h2>

      <p>
        A funny, feel-good, game of hot-potato, where the potato is a baby. The first of these films that I'd actually recommend people watch.
        Written and directed by the Coen brothers, this film is on the lighter side of their work and has serious “O Brother Where Art Thou” energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than the 2D Nic Cage graph, I want to reign things in and condense it to a DND-esque alignment chart:
      <ul>
        <li>Good/Neutral/Bad - rough quality of film</li>
        <li>A Lot Of Nic Cage/Some Nic Cage/Bees - how well does this film exemplify Nic Cage</li>
      </ul>
      To kick off the new system (the previous 3 will get alignments added) I can confidently state that Raising Arizona is
      <em>Good/Some Guy</em>

      <p>
        A story as old as time: Nic Cage plays a sexy, one handed baker with expensive tastes while Cher aspires to a loveless marriage with Cage's brother. Predictably, the power of the moon causes them to fall madly in love and morphs this dry slice of late 80s Brooklyn life into a surreal comedy.

      <h2>Un-caged #6, Red Rock West <time datetime="2022-04-21">April 2st, 2022</time></h2>

        Stunning vistas of Southern Wyoming provide a beige canvas on which a story of love, lust, and murder are painted. Love of money, lust for bad decision making, and normal murder. There's enough camp and action throughout to sustain the movie, but only just. Recommended for fans of prairies and dramatic train escapes.

      <h2>Un-caged #7, The Rock <time datetime="2022-04-21">April 2st, 2022</time></h2>
      The Rock is the first of these early Nic Cage movies that I'd heard of, which led me to commit the cardinal sin of movie watching: having expectations. Sean Connery plays a former SaS agent who's been imprisoned for most of his life under suspicion of knowing too much. Reverse prison breaks ensues and Cage acts very scared of glass potpourri before eventually winning the day by scaring off several F16s with fire, their one weakness.
