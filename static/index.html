          Expect new articles twice a week, nominally Wednesday and Sunday.

          In my day job I work with python, and for side projects I've been working with Go and Elm so expect to see writing in those areas.
          I also have a long standing interest in all things optimization, be it mathematical, financial, or domestic.
          Finally, I'll probably post some poorly researched thoughts on homomorphic encryption because I think it's cool.
          As a reader, I hope you find the writing entertaining and informative.
          As a writer, the purpose of this blog is three-fold: First to improve my writing and communication skills, second to practice being wrong in a public forum, and finally create a record of my thoughts and work.

          When I'm not hunched over a computer, I try to be in the woods, or sometimes a brewery.

          <h2>Privacy Respecting Apps <time datetime="2022-03-04">March 4th, 2022</time></h2>
          <p>
            There is a market for apps which prioritize actual user experience, part of which is respecting their users privacy. Several articles have been circulating recently on Hacker News emphasizing the potential downsides of very popular and highly functional apps like <a href="https://www.kolide.com/blog/is-grammarly-a-keylogger-what-can-you-do-about-it"> Grammarly </a> for writing and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/16/my-journey-down-the-rabbit-hole-of-every-journalists-favorite-app-00009216"> Otter.ai </a> for dictation.
            As people become more aware of the privacy and potential legal implications of sharing unspecified swaths of personal data, from well established mega-corps down to start-ups with a flashy landing page, there is the potential to disrupt these established Apps. For many, an app which is "good enough "and doesn't steal your data might be preferable, and the open source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech"> Mozilla's DeepSpeech</a> will help bridge the data & technology gap. Would it be possible to reach feature parity with Grammarly using only a publicly available corpus? I'd expect the internet, and this site in particular, to provide ample examples of poor grammar.

            While the state of freely-available technology might be lowering the entry to these niches, there is another adjacent niche that seems under explored: that of true personalization. Other than some fine tuning on voice assistants and collaborative filtering applications such as Pandora, most machine learning based applications only use your data to benefit you in a very dilute sense. By casting your cup of information into the vast training sea you should be having a fractionally better experience (assuming you're part of a segment large enough to be optimized for), but few companies are able to adapt their offering more directly to you.

        <h2>Nicolas Un-caged #1, "Valley Girl" <time datetime="2022-03-06">March 6th, 2022</time></h2>
        
        <article>
          <p>At new years every year, some friends and I run a white elephant new years resolution.
          Each participant puts a resolution into the hat then in sequence can either draw a new years resolution out of a hat or steal one from an earlier draw.
          The resolution range from trivial to ridiculous and like most new years resolutions, often they are unfulfilled if even attempted.
          My prescribed resolution from 2021 of "Grow an herb garden" went woefully, and as for the previous one I contributed "Start each day with a bracing yodel" I never heard a peep.
          This year, by luck of the draw, I'll be watching every movie starring Nicolas Cage. Without further ado, here's what I thought of "Valley Girl", 1983:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> TLDR: This movie is, like, really not that good, and Nic Cage is so not that hot. </b>
          </p>
          <p>          
          <em>Valley Girl</em> is the first film starring Nicolas Cage, wherein two "punks" from downtown Hollywood get wrapped up in the Suburban drama of some High schoolers from the Valley.
          The most positive experience I had from watching this movie is understanding the valley in question refers to the San Fernando Valley which is part of LA.
          I had always assumed it was related to something agricultural for which I blame Hidden Valley Ranch.
          Secondarily, this film did provide some insight into the US cultural perception of cities: Cities were scary but interesting (up from god awful as depicted in Taxi Driver in 1976) while Suburbia was vacuous and not even that safe due to the casual abuses of the bored denizens.
          I only made it about 40 minutes into this one before I had to call it quits, the repeated flat delivery of "Like, As If" was just to much.
